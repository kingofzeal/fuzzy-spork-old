A fascinating picture, isn't it? A fuzzy spork. It conjures images that raise far more questions than they answer. What does it mean? What could make a spork fuzzy? Is it safe? Is it supposed to be like that? Is it really a fuzzy spork or is it a sporked fuzzy? Where are the adults?<!-- more -->

Honestly, I can't give any answers to any of these, especially that last one. However, I can honestly say that if I ever do see a fuzzy spork in real life, I'm going to be looking very closely to see just what's up with it.

And that's what this is all about: taking a closer look at things that are strange and mystifying, trying to understand it, and then sharing what we now know with everyone else.

I'm sure it won't always be the most illuminating journey, but one thing is for sure: someone, somewhere, is going to have fun taking it. And it's probably going to be me.
